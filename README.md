Hey guys!

I did the best I could under the circumstances and I think I did reasonably well, even though the project most likely doesn't work. I encountered several problems along the way, as this is my first attempt at working with AR. 

Problem #!: I have an ANCIENT phone from 2014 (Iphone 6), which has entirely too little space to fit any OS Upgrades, hence I am stuck on IOS 12.something.
Problem #2: I could not access developer mode on the phone (even though I tried looking up resources on how to do that).
Problem #3: I was not able to find a way to emulate a phone on a PC. I have a PC capable of running most things but I do not know how to emulate phones (for testing purposes).
Problem #4: Since I could not really test the application I have written the code like I think it might work. There are probably things wrong with it, but considering I was not able to test it, it looks to be at least almost there, based on what I have been able to read on the documentation.
